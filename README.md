# ultra-portable-vital-monitoring

This repo contains a copy of the firmware I designed as a part of my MEng Electronic Engineering degree at the University of Southampton, sponsored by Analog Devices. This firmware has been published with the permission of Analog Devices.
The firmware was my contribution to the Group Design Project I had to undertake as a part of my Masters. As a team of 5 we designed and built an ultra-portable vital sign monitor using a Nordic nrf52832 MCU.


The firmware was designed using ZephyrRTOS.
